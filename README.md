### Inline systems
Inline Systems, e.g., print inspection, surface inspection and gauging/applying grammage measurement

The unified GSM (grams per square meter) provides a more uniform scale for evaluating paper weight and thickness.

You will be deeply involved in different development activities?

Develop systems and equipment for defect analysis using different process measuring systems, camera-based control systems and similar

Improve defect classification using different technologies within AI or similar

What is the usual percentage margin that you have seen in some of the products?

#### Q1
I think  I would be a good fit for this position because I had the opportunity to work as an embedded systems engineer for more than 10 years. During this time, I worked with several aspects of the development cycle of electronic devices/products. This includes helping to mature an initial idea, requirement collection, hardware and firmware design and implementation, on-field testing, sometimes helping with production logistics, troubleshooting and client support. During 7 years I was part of an engineering team where we built radio and telemetry systems. After this, I worked for a company where we built industrial computers for the Oil and gas industry. Most of the time I was in charge of keeping software frameworks to make product functionalities mantenible and scalable.
It is important to mention that I was very lucky to share all these years with talented people, easy to cooperate with and open to sharing their knowledge. This environment boosts your curiosity and love for what you do so you can persevere when problems seem impossible to solve.


For the last 5 years, I have been involved in software-intensive activities like data analysis, image processing and more recently safety-critical software. 

For 3 years I worked for UMN processing multimodal data in order to characterize neural activity which, in turn, could be useful to improve an implant-based treatment for Parkinsons. Data included video and bioelectrical signal records. For example, video was analysed in order to detect, limb movement, drowsiness, pupil movement, and blinking.


Example 1 brain implant  

Example 2 OS for a car It is unacceptable to fail with a blue screen. is safe and what is not safe   

Now I have been working as a consultant for Volvo. My main role as a team member has been to change the existing code for a service and application framework to comply  with safety standards.

Now and in some of my previous jobs the used methodology has been agile.

I have learned that giving the right answer is a good beginning, but it is not enough.   

The entire process matters. Today sustainability is a must. energy matters, reliability matters, minimizing waste matters, optimizing resource consumption matters.
I believe Tetrapack has I key role in the global food chain, and I feel really inspired by the company goal to make food safe and available, everywhere and we promise to protect what’s good - protecting food, people and the planet”.  I am really enthusiastic about the idea of being part of this purpose since my contributions as a development engineer
